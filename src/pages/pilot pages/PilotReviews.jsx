                This page should show the average rating given to the pilot by clients.
                It should also allow the pilot to view specific reviews given by clients.

                In a seperate tab, the pilot should be able to view all of the reviews they've
                given to clients. It should also allow the pilots to view specific reviews they've
                given to clients, as well as edit or delete them.
