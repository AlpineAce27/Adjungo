            <p>
                This page should give a quick overview of the pilots applying to your listings.
                It will show in list form with each pilots rating, # of completed flights, which
                listing they are applying for, a link to the pilot's profile, and a button to
                accept or deny the application.
                Each of these header labels would be clickable and result in the applications being
                filtered by that field.
            </p>
