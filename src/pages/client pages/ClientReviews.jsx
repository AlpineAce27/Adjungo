                This page should show the average rating given to the client by pilots.
                It should also allow the client to view specific reviews given by pilots.

                In a seperate tab, the client should be able to view all of the reviews they've
                given to pilots. It should also allow the client to view specific reviews they've
                given to pilots, as well as edit or delete them.
